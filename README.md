# GAMESTOP-AMC-PDF-DD
A compilation of the most important and most complete DD posts that are in reddit that will be useful during MOASS. Strongly adviced to download these, and read them. Making this depository because reddit and discord will go down or be strongly attacked during the short squeeze. DD will attempt to answer all doubts and questions regarding the squeeze.
Compiled by u/Contanpe.
Great thanks to the wrinkle brain apes that made such beautiful DD, each of them is credited at the start of each PDF.
NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. I EAT CRAYONS. FUCK YOU KEVIN.

If yall don't know how to use GitHub, No worries! Just click on "View code" and there will be a whole list of PDFs. Just make sure to click on the name of file directly instead of the update.

//Important: When it says (OPEN IN NEW DOCUMENT) or (OPEN PDF) next to a reference to a link or dd inside a pdf, it's because the github already has that as a pdf document; search for it by the title. Enjoy!
